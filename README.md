### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸŒ± I'm interested in software engineering, creative technologies, and VR/AR!

ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are they/them!

### Checkout some of the cool things I've made:
A virtual, interactive desktop pet called [Pigeon Pal](https://github.com/yearofglad/pigeon-pal)

An [AI chatbot](https://github.com/kynsity/DivHacks2023_project) that helps with CS advising at Columbia (And won 1st prize at a Columbia hackathon!)

A [sonification program](https://github.com/SamIAm2000/MIDI_file_thing) written for a giant 6-paneled touchscreen that turns pixels from paintings into sound (Won a $500 grant from the Barnard Computational Science Center!)

["Electric Meat"](https://github.com/SamIAm2000/silicone-skin-sensing) - Interactive silicon skin that screams at varying volumes depending on how hard you press on it
