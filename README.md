- ðŸŒ± [Touching grass in virtual reality](https://github.com/SamIAm2000/touchinggrass)

### Check out some of the cool things I've made/worked on in the past ðŸ¤¯:
- A robot-shooting VR game you can play with your brain waves called [PEW](https://github.com/qaziashikin/PEW) (And won 2nd place at the 2024 Columbia Neureality Hackathon)

- A [sonification program](https://github.com/SamIAm2000/MIDI_file_thing) written for a giant 6-paneled touchscreen that turns pixels from paintings into sound (Won a $500 grant from the Barnard Computational Science Center)

- A program that [deconstructs your face and puts it into spinning windows](https://github.com/SamIAm2000/viz_wall_2024) (Won another $500 grant from the Barnard Computational Science Center)

- ["Electric Meat"](https://github.com/SamIAm2000/silicone-skin-sensing) - Interactive silicon skin that screams at varying volumes depending on how hard you press on it
